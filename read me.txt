Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Analyst position at KPMG. With a strong background in Python, SQL, and data visualization, I am eager to contribute my analytical skills to support data-driven decision-making at your organization.

In my previous projects, I worked with large datasets to clean, analyze, and visualize insights using tools such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. For example, I developed a data analysis project on customer behavior that improved reporting efficiency by 20%. I am confident that my ability to translate data into actionable insights aligns well with the needs of your team.

 I would be excited to be part of such a forward-thinking environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and passion for data analysis can contribute to your teamâ€™s success.

Sincerely,
