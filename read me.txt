# 🚗 Car Price Prediction & Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a car dataset, cleans the data, performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and applies Machine Learning models to predict car prices.

## 📊 Steps
1. Data Cleaning (removed $, hp, ranges, handled NaN values).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using seaborn & matplotlib.
3. Built ML models (Linear Regression & Random Forest).
4. Evaluated model performance using MAE, RMSE, R².
5. Visualized Actual vs Predicted car prices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Results
- Random Forest performed best with higher R² accuracy compared to Linear Regression.
- HorsePower & Torque had strong influence on price.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Try advanced models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting).
- Build a Streamlit web app for live predictions.
- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud / Heroku.

## 📂 Dataset
- File: `cleaned_car_dataset.csv`
